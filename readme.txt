Estimate and add the EU flat import duty as a clear checkout line for parcels shipped into the EU from outside it. WooCommerce ready.

== Description ==

From 1 July 2026 the EU removes the 150 EUR duty-free threshold for low-value imports and applies a flat customs duty per tariff line on consignments up to 150 EUR shipped into the EU from outside it. Customs estimates that duty and shows it to the shopper as its own line at cart and checkout, so there are no surprise charges on delivery.

It only adds the duty when all of these are true: the feature is enabled, the store ships from outside the EU, the destination is an EU country, and the cart goods value is at or below your threshold. Intra-EU orders and orders over the threshold are left untouched.

What it does:

* Adds an "EU import duty (estimate)" fee at cart and checkout using the native WooCommerce fees API
* Calculates the duty as the number of distinct tariff lines in the cart multiplied by your per-line amount
* Counts tariff lines from a per-product tariff code, falling back to the product category, then the product
* Works in the classic checkout and the Cart and Checkout Blocks, and is HPOS compatible
* Per-line amount, threshold, store origin country, EUR conversion rate, tariff-line basis, fee label and taxable flag are all configurable
* Adds taxes on top: the duty is shown as its own line in addition to VAT

This is the WooCommerce equivalent of the import duty handling that hosted platforms add at checkout, without a monthly subscription.

== Translations ==

Customs is fully translatable and ships the `plogins-customs.pot` template. Translations are delivered by WordPress.org language packs from translate.wordpress.org, which is where Polish, German and Spanish are being contributed; the package itself carries no compiled translation files.

== Installation ==

1. Install and activate WooCommerce.
2. Install Customs and activate it.
3. Open WooCommerce and then EU Import Duty, set your per-line amount and threshold, and confirm your store origin country.
4. Assign tariff codes to products if you want finer control, otherwise each distinct product category counts as one line. If your subcategories are variations on one thing, tick "Count a subcategory under the category it sits in" and Books > Health and Books > Self improvement become one line instead of two.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= When does the duty apply? =
Only for orders shipping to an EU country from a store based outside the EU, with a goods value at or below your threshold (150 EUR by default). Intra-EU orders are excluded.

= How is the duty calculated? =
The number of distinct tariff lines in the cart multiplied by your per-line amount (3 EUR by default). A parcel of one product type is one line; a parcel spanning several distinct categories counts as several lines. Whether a subcategory counts on its own or under its parent is a setting, and a tariff code overrides both.

= Does it work with the Cart and Checkout Blocks? =
Yes. The duty is added through the native WooCommerce fees API, so it appears in both the classic checkout and the Blocks checkout, and it is HPOS compatible.

= Is the amount exact? =
It is an estimate based on your settings. Final duties and any national handling fees are determined by customs at import. Keep your per-line amount and threshold up to date with current rules.

= Can I sell in a currency other than EUR? =
Yes. Set the EUR to store-currency rate in the settings and the duty is converted before it is added.


= Does this plugin work on WordPress Multisite? =

Yes. This plugin is compatible with WordPress Multisite. Network activate it or activate it on individual sites; each site keeps its own settings and data.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0.14 =
* Fixed: the package no longer ships its own translation files. WordPress.org builds language packs from translate.wordpress.org, and a bundled catalogue shadows that pack, so a translation corrected upstream could not reach you until the next release. Your language now comes from the language pack, which is the copy that stays current.

= 1.0.13 =
* Fixed: the subcategory grouping checkbox added in 1.0.12 could not be saved. The field was drawn on the settings screen but its name was missing from the list the save routine reads, so ticking it and pressing save left it unticked, every time. If you tried to use it after updating to 1.0.12 and concluded it did nothing, it really did nothing, and this release is the one that makes it work.
* Fixed: with grouping off, 1.0.12 did not behave like 1.0.10 as its changelog claimed. It picked the category with the lowest internal id instead of the first one WooCommerce returns, which is a different answer for any product filed in more than one category, and could merge two tariff lines into one and halve the duty on a shop that never touched the new setting. The old behaviour is back.
* Fixed: the tariff-code coverage line on the settings screen counted a code consisting only of spaces as present, while the duty calculation trims it and ignores it. The two now agree.

= 1.0.12 =
* Fixed: 1.0.11 made every subcategory count under its parent, which was wrong for as many shops as it was right for. A shop selling Books > Health and Books > Self improvement wants one tariff line; a shop selling Other Products > Beads and Other Products > Pictures wants two. The category tree carries nothing that tells those two apart, so 1.0.11 quietly halved the second shop's duty. Grouping is now a setting, off by default, which restores what 1.0.10 did for anyone who did not want it.
* Added: the settings screen now reports how many published products carry a tariff code the plugin can actually read. Entering codes and seeing nothing change is otherwise indistinguishable from the plugin not seeing them: the field sits on the product's Shipping tab, which WooCommerce hides for virtual products, and a code held in another plugin's field is not read here.

= 1.0.11 =
* Fixed: subcategories were counted as separate tariff lines. A cart holding a book from Books > Health and a book from Books > Self improvement was charged two lines instead of one, because the count used whichever category WooCommerce returned first and never looked at the category it sits under. Every assigned category is now resolved to its own top-level parent, so the charge no longer depends on how deep a shop's categories go or on whether the parent category was ticked as well.
* Fixed: the plugin reported 1.0.9 as its own version while its header said 1.0.10. The build now refuses to package when the header, the version constant and the readme's stable tag disagree.
* Added: a `customs/tariff_line_key` filter, for classifying a product by something the plugin does not know about, such as a real HS heading held in another plugin's meta.

= 1.0.10 =
* Declared compatibility with WooCommerce 11.0.

= 1.0.9 =
* Removed the PRO notice from the settings screen. It advertised an edition that does not exist yet, so there was nothing behind it to click through to.
* Added an uninstall routine: deleting the plugin now removes its settings, and the dismissal flag the removed notice left on user accounts.

= 1.0.8 =
* Fix: the PRO notice in the admin linked to a page that does not exist yet and returned a 404. It now points at the plugin page, and its wording no longer says the plans wait on a WordPress.org approval that has already happened.

= 1.0.6 =
* Declared compatibility with WooCommerce 10.9.

= 1.0.5 =
* Documentation: readme links are now labelled links.

= 1.0.4 =
* Shortened display name (dropped the Plogins prefix; slug unchanged).

= 1.0.3 =
* Added bundled Polish, German and Spanish translations for the plugin interface.

= 1.0.2 =
* Corrected the Polish, German and Spanish translations (customs terminology: Einfuhrzoll, Zolltarifnummer, cło importowe, arancel).

= 1.0.1 =
* First stable release.

= 0.1.4 =
* Added bundled Polish, German and Spanish translations for the plugin interface.
* Refreshed the translation template for the current text domain and settings strings.

= 0.1.3 =
* Added a settings-screen overview of upcoming PRO features (live exchange rates, HS-code classification). No change to the free duty calculation.

= 0.1.2 =
* Text domain now matches the plugin slug (plogins-customs) across all strings and the translation template, so wp.org language packs work.

= 0.1.1 =
* Restored the wp.org-aligned bootstrap file name, text domain and translation template for the `customs` slug.

= 0.1.0 =
* Initial release: EU flat import duty estimated and added as a cart and checkout fee, with configurable per-line amount, threshold, store origin, currency rate, tariff-line basis, label and taxable flag.
